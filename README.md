# GivingSpoon
A SwiftUI and Firebase-based app that connects donors, volunteers, and beneficiaries to redistribute surplus food efficiently.

GivingSpoon helps redistribute surplus food from restaurants to homeless shelters with the help of volunteers. Donors can post available meals, volunteers can pick them up, and shelters can receive fresh food, all through a single platform.
Main Features: 
- Donor, volunteer, and beneficiary roles
- Firebase authentication and data storage
- Clean SwiftUI design with modern UI
- Easy meal posting and pickup status updates
Inspiration: I wanted to make a real impact by reducing food waste and helping local shelters receive more consistent food donations.
Built with: SwiftUI and Firebase (Firestore, Auth)
How it works:
- Donors post surplus meals
- Volunteers claim pickups
- Meals get delivered to shelters
- Everyone wins
Future plans
- Real-time map tracking
- AI-based surplus prediction
- community page to showcase impact
